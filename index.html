                    <h2 id="notes">Note: Cooking Deserts Without Sweeteners</h2>
                    <p>My household is vegetarian, diary-free, gluten-free, corn-free, and processed-sugar free. We ate a very strict diet for about a year...until I started craving brownies. Finding truly sugar-free recipes is <i>hard</i>; most "sugar free" recipes just sub out a half-cup of sugar with a half-cup of agave/honey/erythritol instead. My first breakthrough (the strawberry brownies) came after months and months of failure.</p>
                    <p>Here's what I discovered in those months of failure:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It took me about a month to stop craving sugar. Nowadays, I can't handle more than a bite of traditionally sweet deserts.</li>
                        <li>If it doesn't taste good raw, it won't taste good once it's baked. If the dough tastes a little bitter, add something to sweeten it.</li>
                        <li>Oat milk is the most naturally sweet dairy-free milk.</li>
                        <li><a href="http://www.momococoa.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="note-link">Momo Cocoa</a> has the least bitter cocoa powder I've ever had, and in my opinion it's well worth getting if you're trying to avoid sweeteners.</li>

                    <p class="note center">5 min | 1 cup</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 tablespoon cocoa powder</li>
                        <li>10 - 12 oz oat milk</li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                        <li>1 drop peppermint oil OR a sprinkle ground cinnamon OR zest from 1/2 a large orange <span class="note">optional, for flavor</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="note">For peppermint, cinnamon, or orange hot chocolate. Spicy-smoky hot chocolate is found <a class="note-link" href="#spicy-cocoa">here</a>.</p>
                    <p><i>The proper way:</i> Warm the oat milk in a saucepan over medium heat until it's at or a little above drinking temperature (don't let it boil!). Add the other ingredients and wisk until the chocolate is all disolved.</p>
                    <p><i>The lazy way:</i> Microwave the oat milk for about 1 1/2 - 2 minutes, or until it's at drinking temperature. Add the other ingredients and stir carefully until blended.</p>

                    <p class="note center">15-30 min | 2 entrees</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 package noodles <span class="note">(I like a chickpea pasta like <a class="note-link" href="https://www.eatbanza.com/products/shells" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">banza</a> for extra protein and low carbs)</span></li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
                        <li>1 package frozen broccoli or cauliflower</li>
                        <li>about a quarter cup tahini</li>
                        <li>about 3 tablespoons nutritional yeast</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce</li>
                        <li>2 teaspoons dijon mustard</li>
                        <li>water</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="note">This recipe is my take on a vegan Welsh Rabbit sauce. Welsh Rabbit typically includes a roux base and white wine or beer, but I haven't been satisfied with the results when I've used them with vegan cheese. But go ahead and add a bit of dark beer or white wine to the sauce if you want.</p>
                    <p>Cook the pasta according to its instructions.</p>
                    <p>As the pasta is cooking, add the tahini, nutritional yeast, worcestershire sauce, and dijon mustard to a bowl, stirring until combined. Add water and stir until the sauce is very runny (too runny for good cheese sauce). Taste the sauce at this point, and add more nutritional yeast for cheesiness, and more dijon and worcestershire sauce for spiciness.</p>
                    <p>Add the oil and frozen broccoli to a skillet. Sautee the broccoli on med-high heat, stirring frequently, until the extra water is cooked off and the broccoli is browning. Turn the heat off and pour the sauce into the pan, stirring constantly. There should be enough risidual heat in the pan to warm the sauce and evaporate off the extra water; add more water if needed.</p>
                    <p>Pour the sauce into the cooked, drained pasta, and enjoy!</p>

                    <h2 id="kimchi-fried-rice">Kimchi Fried Rice</h2>
                    <p class="note center">15 min | 2 entrees or ~4 sides</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>18 oz kimchi</li>
                        <li>about 2 cups <a href="#no-rice-cooker-rice" class="note-link">cooked rice</a></li>
                        <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
                        <li>12 oz tofu OR 4 eggs</li>
                        <li>2 teaspoons cooking oil <span class="note">sesame/peanut preferred</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Add the oil and the frozen peas to a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tofu now, if using. Stir the pan frequently until all extra water is evaporated from the pan*. This should take about 5-10 minutes, depending on if you used tofu or not.</p>
                    <p>If using eggs: once the peas are cooked, turn off the heat and let the pan cool for about 2-3 minutes (to avoid rubbery eggs!). Turn the heat on medium-low and add another teaspoon of oil if needed before adding the eggs. Scramble the eggs until they're just about done, but not quite--the eggs should still be slightly runny.</p>
                    <p>Turn the pan up to medium-high heat again. Add the kimchi and rice, and sautee until the extra water is evaporated from the pan (see above), stirring constantly. This should take no longer than 3 minutes or so. If it's taking too long, turn up the heat.<p>
                    <p class="note">* This step is important in order to avoid soggy steamed veggies. The excess moisture will have evaporated off when the "hiss" of oil meeting water has stopped, and you see no water spreading from under the veggies as you stir the pan. If you notice some veggies are burning while there's still water in the pan, turn the heat down and stir more often (don't worry too much if veggies burn--the stir-fry sauce [in this case, kimchi] will un-stick the pan).</p>

                    <h2 id="no-rice-cooker-rice">No Rice-Cooker Rice</h2>
                    <p class="note center">30 min | About 4 cups or so of cooked rice</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Uncooked rice <span class="note">roughly 2 cups or so</span></li>
                        <li>1-quart saucepan <span class="note">NOT non-stick</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="note">This is less of a recipe and more of a rule of thumb, but it's easier than it looks!</p>
                    <p class="note">You're going to be relying on sight and smell more than usual in this recipe, especially since different rice varieties require different water ratios and cooking times. I recommend starting with "regular" brown rice (NOT the quick-cooking kind), as it doesn't burn as easily as white rice and and works well with the water/rice ratio we're using here.</p>
                    <p>Add the rice to the saucepan. Stick your index finger into the pan, strait down; the rice should go up to your first finger joint.</p>
                    <p>Rinse your rice in cold water several times, until the water runs clear (dig your hand into it and really mix it up; you'll be amazed by how much extra hulls and starch you can get off some brands). Be careful when dumping out the water so as to not dump out the rice too.</p>
                    <p>Stick your finger strait down in the pan again, and add cold water until it's slightly above your second knuckle.</p>
                    <p>Put the pot on a burner on medium-high heat, uncovered. Wait until the pot is boiling.</p>
                    <p>Let it boil for one minute, then cover the pot and turn the heat down to low (about a 3-4 out of 10, heat-wise).</p>
                    <p>At this point, the rice needs to just sit for a certain amount of time to steam. White rice cooks in about 10-15 minutes, and brown rice will take between 30-40 minutes. I recommend setting a timer to either 10 or 30 minutes, and then quickly lifting the lid and moving the rice gently to the side with a spoon so you can check how much water is left in the pot. If there's still water, then replace the lid and set the timer for another 5 minutes.</p> 
                    <p>The rice is done when the top of the rice has "pits" in it (you'll know it when you see it) and the water in the bottom of the pan is absorbed (the lid and sides should still have some level of condensation on them though). If the rice is still a bit hard or chewy, add a few tablespoons of water to the pan and let it cook for 5 minutes longer. If you smell popcorn, the rice is overcooked and the bottom layer burned--the rest of the rice will be fine though, and the burnt rice will come off pretty easily if you soak the pot.</p>

                    <p class="note center">45 min | Makes 8 pieces of cake</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>4 large eggs</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon maple syrup <span class="note">more to taste</span></li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup non-dairy milk</li>
                        <li>1 cup almond flour</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                        <li>zest of 1 large orange</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p class="note">This recipe makes quite a moist cake, so I'd recommend eating it alone (or with some whipped cream on top). If you want to go all-out with ice cream, try adding a little less almond milk--maybe 1/3 cup instead.</p>
                    <p>Preheat oven to 325°F. Grease an 8x8-inch glass pan (or a 9-inch glass pie plate) with your oil of choice, or use oven-safe wax paper to reduce mess.</p>
                    <p>Whisk together the eggs, maple syrup, vanilla, and milk in a large mixing bowl.</p>
                    <p>Gradually whisk in the almond flour and cocoa flour.</p>
                    <p>Whisk in the spices, baking soda, and orange zest. The batter will be pretty thin.</p>
                    <p>Pour the batter into the glass pan and bake for 15 minutes, then cover the top of the cake with tin foil so it doesn't burn. Continue to cook the cake for 10-15 minutes longer, or until the center is set (a toothpick stabbed into the center should come out clean).</p>
                    <p>Cool the cake on a cooling rack until it reaches room temperature. Store the remaining slices in the fridge.</p>

                    <p>Cook for a few minutes longer until the cranberries are mostly popped and the sauce has thickened to the desired consistency. Take the pan off of the heat, and stir in the vanilla extract. Let it cool before storing it.</p>

                    <p class="note center">30 min | 3 - 4 cookies each<p> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>6 tablespoons vegan butter</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                        <li>2 + 1/4 cups almond meal</li>
                        <li>1/4 cup ground flax seed</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup <a class="note-link" href="#chai-cranberry-sauce">chai-spiced cranberry sauce</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Preheat the oven to 350˚F. Line one large baking sheet with parchment paper.</p>
                    <p>In a large bowl, beat the butter until it becomes fluffy (it has a better texture this way, I swear). Then add the vanilla extract and whisk until well combined.</p>
                    <p>Add the almond meal and flax to the butter a half cup at a time. The dough should get much less crumbly after adding in the flax.</p>
                    <p>Scoop about 1 tablespoon of the dough into balls, and press your thumb into the center of each one. The dough will crack a little, but it'll be fine; that's what the flax is there for. Bake for about 12 - 14 minutes, or until they are golden brown. Allow the cookies to cool for about 5 minutes before handling them.</p>
                    <p>Fill the center of each cookie with a half teaspoon of the chai-spiced cranberry sauce.</p>

                    <p class="note center">2 - 15 min | 1 serving</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 cup oat milk</li>
                        <li>2 teaspoons cocoa <span class="note">or more to taste</span></li>
                        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                        <li>1/8 teaspoon chipotle powder <span class="note">or less to taste</span></li>

                    </ul>
                    <p><i>The proper way:</i> Warm the oat milk in a saucepan over medium heat until it's at or a little above drinking temperature (don't let it boil!). Add the other ingredients and wisk until the chocolate is all disolved.</p>
                    <p><i>The lazy way:</i> Microwave the oat milk for about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, or until it's at drinking temperature. Add the other ingredients and stir carefully until blended.</p>
