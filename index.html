                    <ul>
                        <li>4 large eggs</li>
                        <li>1/4 cup melted coconut oil</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup gluten free flour*</li>
                        <li>1/4 cup cocoa powder**</li>
                        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon espresso-grind coffee or instant coffee powder <span class="note">optional, but recommended</span></li>
                        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground chai spice <span class="note">optional, but recommended</span></li>
                        <li>1 + 1/2 cup pureed strawberries <span class="note">thawed frozen fruit works well</span></li>
                        <li>Maple syrup or honey if needed</p>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="note">* I use <a class="note-link" href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/gluten-free-all-purpose-baking-flour.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bob's Red Mill All Purpose Gluten Free flour</a>, which is mostly chickpea flour. <b>All flours are not created equally</b>, so I don't recommend experimenting with other flours; if you do, you'll probably need to add less pureed strawberries because chickpea flour absorbs a lot of liquid.</p>
                    <p class="note">** A high quality cocoa powder is essential for this recipe due to the low sugar content.</p>
                    <p>Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease an 8x8-inch pan with your oil of choice, or use oven-safe wax paper to reduce mess.</p>
                    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, melted coconut oil, and vanilla until smooth.</p>
                    <p>In a smaller bowl, mix the flour, cocoa powder, espresso powder, chai spice, baking soda, and salt. Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, being sure to remove any clumps.<p>
                    <p>Add the pureed fruit to the mix and fold until completely mixed. Taste the dough, and add about 1 tablespoon of maple syrup or honey at a time to taste.</p> 
                    <p>Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and cook for about 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick/knife inserted into the middle comes out clean. <b>Don't be alarmed if this needs to cook for significantly longer than this</b>-- chickpea flour cooks slowly and I haven't timed this in a while.</p>

                    <p class="note center">20 mins | Try to save some for the thumbprint cookies, okay?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>10-12 oz pack of fresh or frozen cranberries</li>
                        <li>3/4 cup water</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon maple syrup <span class="note">or more to taste</span></li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon ground chai spice</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Add the cranberries and water to a small saucepan, and cook on medium heat for 10-15 minutes until the cranberries begin to pop. Add the ground chai spice and maple syrup, and stir to combine.</p>
                    <p>Cook for a few minutes longer until the cranberries are mostly popped and the sauce has thickened to the desired consistency. Take the pan off of the heat, and stir in the vanilla extract. Let it cool before storing it.</p>

                    <h2 id="cranberry-chai-thumbprint">Cranberry Chai Thumbprint Cookies</h2>
                    <p class="note center">30 min | 3 - 4 cookies each<p> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>6 tablespoons vegan butter</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                        <li>2 + 1/4 cups almond meal</li>
                        <li>1/4 cup ground flax seed</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup <a class="note-link" href="#chai-cranberry-sauce">chai-spiced cranberry sauce</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Preheat the oven to 350˚F. Line one large baking sheet with parchment paper.</p>
                    <p>In a large bowl, beat the butter until it becomes fluffy (it has a better texture this way, I swear). Then add the vanilla extract and whisk until well combined.</p>
                    <p>Add the almond meal and flax to the butter a half cup at a time. The dough should get much less crumbly after adding in the flax.</p>
                    <p>Scoop about 1 tablespoon of the dough into balls, and press your thumb into the center of each one. The dough will crack a little, but it'll be fine; that's what the flax is there for. Bake for about 12 - 14 minutes, or until they are golden brown. Allow the cookies to cool for about 5 minutes before handling them.</p>
                    <p>Fill the center of each cookie with a half teaspoon of the chai-spiced cranberry sauce.</p>

                    <p class="note center">2 - 15 min | 1 serving</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 cup oat milk*</li>
                        <li>2 teaspoons cocoa** <span class="note">or more to taste</span></li>
                        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                        <li>1/8 teaspoon chipotle powder <span class="note">or less to taste</span></li>
                        <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                        <li>A pinch of smoked salt <span class="note">optional</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="note">* Oat milk is naturally a bit sweet which makes it great for hot cocoa! If you're using another type of milk, you may need to add a bit of honey or maple syrup.</p>
                    <p class="note">** A high quality cocoa powder is essential for this recipe due to the low sugar content.</p>
                    <p><i>The proper way:</i> Warm the oat milk in a saucepan over medium heat until it's at or a little above drinking temperature (don't let it boil!). Add the other ingredients and wisk until the chocolate is all disolved.</p>
                    <p><i>The lazy way:</i> Microwave the oat milk for about 1 to 1 1/2 minutes, or until it's at drinking temperature. Add the other ingredients and stir carefully until blended.</p>
